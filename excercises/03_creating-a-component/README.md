# Creating a Component with SASS

Building reusable components is a key skill in modern web development. SASS enhances this process by allowing for more organized, maintainable, and scalable styles. In this section, we will design a simple, reusable button component using SASS.

## Objectives:
- Understand the concept of a component in web design.
- Learn to use SASS features to create a modular and reusable button component.
- Apply best practices for component-based design in SASS.

## Creating a Button Component
We'll create a button component that is customizable through variables and mixins, allowing for easy adjustments and variations.

## Practice
Follow along with the provided `index.html` and `style.scss` files to create your button component. Try to add additional styles or variations to your component to explore the flexibility SASS offers.

Happy component building!
