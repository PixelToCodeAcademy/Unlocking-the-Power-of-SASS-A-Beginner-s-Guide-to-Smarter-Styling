# Basic Structure and Setup for SASS

Welcome to the first part of our SASS tutorial! In this section, we'll cover the basic structure and setup required to start using SASS in your web projects. SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

## Objectives:
- Understand what SASS is and its benefits.
- Learn how to install SASS.
- Set up a basic structure for a SASS project.
- Compile SASS to CSS.

## Installation
To use SASS, you need to have it installed on your machine. You can install it using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in your terminal:


## Project Structure
A simple project structure for a SASS project includes at least two main directories: one for your SASS files (`.scss`) and one for your compiled CSS. This example project also includes a basic `index.html` file to demonstrate how to link your stylesheets.

## Compilation
To compile your SASS files into CSS, you can use the following command:

Replace `source/styles.scss` with the path to your `.scss` file, and `destination/styles.css` with the path where you want your compiled CSS to go.

## Practice
Try setting up a simple project structure on your own, write some basic styles in SASS, and compile them to CSS. Check the `index.html` and `style.scss` files included in this directory for a starting point.

Happy styling with SASS!
