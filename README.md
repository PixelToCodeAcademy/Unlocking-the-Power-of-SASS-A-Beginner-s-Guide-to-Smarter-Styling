# Unlocking the Power of SASS: A Beginner's Guide to Smarter Styling

Welcome to our SASS for Beginners session! This repository is your starting point to dive into the world of SASS, a powerful CSS preprocessor that enables you to write cleaner, more efficient, and easier-to-maintain CSS code.

## What Is SASS?

SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) extends CSS with features like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance, and more, allowing you to supercharge your stylesheets. It helps you keep your stylesheets dry (Don't Repeat Yourself) and makes managing large stylesheets or working within teams much smoother.

## Getting Started

Before diving into the examples and exercises, you'll need to set up SASS on your machine. Here's how:

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Install SASS globally by running `npm install -g sass` in your terminal.
3. Verify the installation by running `sass --version`.
