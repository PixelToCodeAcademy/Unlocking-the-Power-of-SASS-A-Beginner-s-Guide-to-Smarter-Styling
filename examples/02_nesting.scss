// 02_nesting.scss

// Introduction to Nesting
// Nesting in SASS allows you to write CSS selectors within other selectors. 
// This mirrors the hierarchical structure of HTML and makes the CSS more readable and maintainable.

// Basic Example of Nesting
nav {
    background-color: #333;
    ul {
      list-style: none;
      padding: 0;
      li {
        display: inline-block;
        margin-right: 20px;
        a {
          text-decoration: none;
          color: white;
          &:hover { // Using the & symbol to reference the parent selector
            color: #ccc;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Nesting Properties
  // SASS also allows you to nest CSS properties that use the same namespace.
  .button {
    font: {
      family: Arial, sans-serif;
      size: 16px;
      weight: bold;
    }
    margin: {
      top: 10px;
      bottom: 10px;
    }
  }
  
  // Caution with Deep Nesting
  // While nesting is a powerful feature, it's important to use it wisely. 
  // Deeply nested rules can make CSS harder to read and lead to overly specific selectors. 
  // As a rule of thumb, try not to nest more than 3 levels deep.
  
  // Practice
  // Create a simple HTML structure and use SASS nesting to style it. 
  // Pay attention to how nesting can simplify your CSS and make it more structured.
